# LinesDefinitions

Implement in Java the following geometric operations 
(in the Cartesian coordinate system, i.e. 2D):
1. Definition of a line by means of two points
2. Definition of a line by means of gradient and y-intercept
3. Condition of parallelism of two lines
4. Condition of perpendicularity of two lines
5. Condition of incidence of two lines and definition of the incidence point
Requirement • Classes and methods must be properly unit tested
Important • We are not asking you to draw lines (i.e., no awt or swing); you should simply show 
to be able to model a line and to implement the required conditions •

Please, don’t forget the KISS principle: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle!

Extra • Your project should be compiled and packaged by means of Gradle 
(preferred, it will be considered a plus) or Maven
